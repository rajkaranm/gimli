Gimli is minimal markdown based note-taking. The goal is simple to remove all the distrating feature from your note-taking application and focus on writing.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajkaranm/gimli
cd gimli
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

POV: The app still needs a lot of improvement and I'll be working on it.
